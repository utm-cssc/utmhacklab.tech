# What is the Hacklab?

The UTM Hacklab is an MCS department initiative made for the students of UTM. We're located in room 2014 in UTM's Deerfield Hall building. 

## How do I join the Hacklab?

The Hacklab is still setting up its near to long term infrastructure. 

At the moment, the best way to get involved is to check out the resources on this website, visit our [digital community on Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com), and engage with us in person by visiting our office at UTM in Deerfield Hall Room 2014.
