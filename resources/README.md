## Getting Motivated

It’s a wonderful feeling to be motivated about what you’re learning. Consuming entertaining digital content about your area of education can help you cultivate a sense of wonder.

::: tip Supplementing Course Content
Search these _edu-tainment_ channels for topics in your courses. They may not teach you how to pass a test, but they may help build an understanding of how what you're learning fits in.

### [PBS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)

PBS makes Computer Science education accessible to people of all ages, and this crash course goes into a surprising amount of technical detail.

::: tip CS Education for everyone
I have often used this channel as a guide to provide context for when the content as its taught by professors becomes a bit too technical.

## Collaboration

### Visual Studio Code Live Share

Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug programming projects with other students in real time. It works regardless what programming languages you're using or app types you're building.

It allows you to instantly (and securely) share your current project, and then as needed, share debugging sessions, terminal instances, localhost web apps, and more!

Install VS Code Live Share [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/#install-visual-studio-live-share)
