## Android Jetpack

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and architectural guidance that make it quick and easy to build great Android apps.

Components are individually adoptable but built to work together while taking advantage of Kotlin language features that make you more productive.

Jetpack manages tedious activities like background tasks, navigation, and lifecycle management, so you can eliminate boilerplate code and focus on what makes your app great.
